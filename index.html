                During my time in highschool, I took all the computer science related courses that I could and found that
                I had a great interest in Computer Science and wanted to pursue a career in the field. By the time I was 
                enrolled in college I had made the decision I would have a career in Computer Science or Education and after
                a meeting with a school advisor I had made my decision. If I didn't want to spend an extra year attending (
                and paying for) school, I would have to pursue teaching because of the way my university computer science 
                program was laid out. At the time the choice was a no brainer and I started down the path towards history 
                education. Fortunately, (and yes I DO mean fortunately,) I ended up dropping out of college after one semeseter.
                I spent the next 4 years of my life working every job I could from retail, food, management, warehouse, healthcare, 
                you name it. At the end of the day I knew there was something that was missing, I wanted to learn. Four years
                after I decided to not venuture down the Comp Sci career path, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by peers
                that in one way or another inspired me to seek out knowledge again and once I stumbled down the rabbit hole of
                using the wonderful tool that is the internet to teach myself a skill, I knew that my journey with Comp Sci had not 
                ended when I enrolled in college and that it was ready for me to start again whenever I was ready. And after all that 
                time I have decided that I am ready!
